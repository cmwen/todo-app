## Governance Traceability & Audit

Generated to satisfy the Governance Agent Definition of Done (DoD) gates. This file cross-references project artifacts and records known gaps, gating decisions, and recommended owners/deadlines.

### Snapshot (repo)

- Repository: `todo-app` (monorepo)
- Branch: `main`
- Date: 2025-09-05

### DoD Gate checklist (required documents)

| Required artifact | Path | Present | Notes |
|---|---:|:---:|---|
| Vision | `docs/vision.md` | ✅ | Contains vision, user scenarios, success criteria. |
| Product backlog | `docs/product_backlog.md` | ✅ | Present. Initial backlog added; Product owner should expand items and add priorities/dates. |
| Design | `docs/design.md` | ✅ | Contains high-level design and decisions. |
| Technical design | `docs/technical-design.md` | ✅ | Contains interfaces, schema, DI and roadmap. |
| Implementation summary | `docs/implementation-summary.md` | ✅ | Contains status and implementation notes. |
| QA plan | `docs/qa_plan.md` | ✅ | Present. QA plan added with acceptance criteria and minimal tests. |
| Governance traceability | `docs/governance_traceability.md` | ✅ | This file. |

### Repository hygiene (blocking gate)

- `.gitignore` at repo root: ✅ (ignores Node, Next, pnpm, SQLite files)
- `packages/*/src/` structure: ✅ (frontend, backend, shared present)
- `tests/` or package-level tests: ⚠️ (no `tests/` top-level; packages may not include tests — see below)

Notes: There are no top-level `tests/` folder. Packages reference `test` scripts in package.json but no test files were found by quick search. Add at least smoke tests for backend and shared logic to satisfy the Test & Quality Gate.

### Traceability matrix (high-level)

- Vision → Product: `docs/vision.md` references CLI/Web/MCP modes and required success criteria. Product backlog missing; therefore trace from Vision → Product is incomplete (gap recorded).
- Product → Design: `docs/design.md` maps to Vision and contains [Design → Execution] labels. Mapping exists.
- Design → Execution: `docs/technical-design.md` and `docs/implementation-summary.md` provide execution details and implementation notes; mapping exists.
- Execution → QA: `docs/implementation-summary.md` status exists, but `docs/qa_plan.md` is missing. Execution → QA traceability is incomplete.

### Audit notes (evidence)

- README: Updated to include links to key docs and `governance_traceability.md`.
- package.json (root) contains scripts for `dev`, `build`, `type-check`, and `test` but repo lacks tests — risk for Test & Quality Gate.
- .gitignore present and appears adequate for Repo Hygiene Gate.

### Gating decisions

- Documentation Completeness Gate: UPDATED — required docs are present. Product owner should expand backlog items; QA should replace placeholder tests with real smoke/integration tests before release.
- Repository Hygiene Gate: PASS — `.gitignore` and package structure present.

- Test & Quality Gate: CONDITIONAL — unit/smoke tests are required for new features. No tests detected; require at least one smoke test for backend and one unit test for shared types before final release.

### Recommended immediate actions (owners & deadlines)

1. Create `docs/product_backlog.md` (Owner: Product) — due in 3 working days. Contents: prioritized backlog items, scope for upcoming release, trace links to Vision.
2. Create `docs/qa_plan.md` (Owner: QA/Eng) — due in 3 working days. Contents: acceptance criteria, test matrix, regression checklist, known risks.
3. Add smoke tests (Owner: Engineering) — due in 5 working days. Minimum: backend health endpoint smoke test; shared type unit test.
4. If a deadline cannot be met, record a formal waiver in this file with owner and date.

### Release readiness checklist (derived)

- [ ] All required docs present and cross-referenced (Vision, Product backlog, Design, Technical design, Implementation summary, QA plan, Governance traceability)
- [ ] .gitignore and basic repo structure present
- [ ] Unit/smoke tests for new features in CI
- [ ] CHANGELOG/release notes with links to design/execution items
- [ ] Known risks documented in QA plan

### In-flight work items (observed)

- Frontend (Next.js) — implemented in `packages/frontend` (UI, components, WebSocket client)
- Backend (WebSocket server) — implemented in `packages/backend` (server, handlers, in-memory DB)
- Shared types/utilities — implemented in `packages/shared`
- CLI / MCP packages — planned (not yet present)

### Retrospective notes & improvements

- Traceability gaps occur where Product/QA artifacts are not checked-in early. Recommend adding Product/QA templates in `docs/templates/` and gating PR merges that touch design/execution without updating the traceability file.
- Add a simple CI job that validates presence of the DoD documents and runs smoke tests; fail CI if blocking docs are missing.

## Release summary & readiness checklist

- Current scope for release (suggested): deliverable surface limited to existing packages: `frontend`, `backend`, `shared` with documentation updated and smoke tests added.

- Release readiness quick-check:
	- Documentation: product backlog and QA plan must be added or waived. (BLOCKER)
	- Tests: smoke tests for backend health and shared type validation (REQUIRED before release)
	- Changelog: ensure `CHANGELOG.md` or release notes exist with links to `docs/technical-design.md` and `docs/implementation-summary.md` (RECOMMENDED)
	- Versioning: bump package versions and tag release in Git (RECOMMENDED)

If the Product owner confirms scope reduction (frontend+backend only) and provides a signed waiver for Product backlog/QA plan, a limited release may proceed with an explicit waiver recorded here (owner name, reason, and deadline).

## Short-term next steps (concrete)

1. Product: Add `docs/product_backlog.md` with prioritized items and trace links to `docs/vision.md`. (3 days)
2. QA/Eng: Add `docs/qa_plan.md` with acceptance criteria and a test matrix. (3 days)
3. Engineering: Add smoke test for `http://localhost:8081/health` and a unit test for shared type validation. (5 days)
4. CI: Add a gating step that ensures the two docs are present and runs the smoke tests. (5 days)
