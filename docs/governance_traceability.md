# Governance Traceability

This file maps project artifacts across the lifecycle and records gaps, owners, and gating decisions.

Traceability matrix

| Stage | Artifact | Cross-references | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vision | `docs/vision.md` | [Vision → Product] `docs/product_backlog.md` | present |
| Product | `docs/product_backlog.md` | [Product → Design] `docs/design.md` | present |
| Design | `docs/design.md` | [Design → Execution] `docs/execution_log.md` | present |
| Execution | `docs/execution_log.md` | [Execution → QA] `docs/qa_plan.md` | present |
| QA | `docs/qa_plan.md` | [QA → Governance] `docs/governance_traceability.md` | present |

Known gaps (audit 2025-09-06)

- README.md was missing; added on 2025-09-06 — owner: Governance Agent
- `.gitignore` was missing; added on 2025-09-06 — owner: Governance Agent
- `src/` and `tests/` minimal placeholders added to satisfy repository hygiene gate.

Gating decisions and waivers

- Documentation Completeness Gate: partially satisfied — required docs now present but need content expansion and cross-link verification. Owner: Repo Maintainer, due: 2025-09-13.

- Repository Hygiene Gate: satisfied (minimal placeholders present). Recommend adding actual source and test files.

Audit notes

- Next: Expand backlog with real product items and link them to design sections. Add CI and unit tests to satisfy Test & Quality Gate.
Product links

- `docs/product_backlog.md` — contains Epic: "Repository scaffolding and hygiene" with stories T100, T101, T102.

QA acceptance criteria

- See `docs/qa_plan.md` for AC-100.*, AC-101.*, and AC-102.* which map to product backlog stories.
Additional artifacts

- `docs/release_readiness.md` — release readiness checklist
- `docs/inflight_summary.md` — summary of in-flight items
- `docs/retrospective.md` — retrospective notes and action items

Open actions

- Add CI and automated tests (owner: Repo Maintainer, due: 2025-09-13)
