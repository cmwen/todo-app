# Release Readiness Checklist

Checklist (quick pass)

- [ ] Documentation completeness: `docs/vision.md`, `docs/product_backlog.md`, `docs/design.md`, `docs/execution_log.md`, `docs/qa_plan.md`, `docs/governance_traceability.md` (present) — action: expand content where needed.
- [ ] README with quick start (present)
- [ ] Repository hygiene: `.gitignore`, `src/`, `tests/` (present)
- [ ] Unit tests: none detected — action: add unit tests for new features before release.
- [ ] QA plan: basic template present — action: add acceptance criteria and test owners.
- [ ] CHANGELOG/Release notes: none — action: create `CHANGELOG.md` when release prepared.

Status: not ready for release; blockers: missing automated tests and detailed acceptance criteria.

Recommended immediate next steps

- Create a minimal CI workflow that runs unit tests (GitHub Actions or equivalent).
- Add at least one unit test covering a core path.
- Populate `CHANGELOG.md` when ready to cut a release.
