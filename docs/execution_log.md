# Execution Log

Records of key execution events, implementation progress, and decisions. Each entry should reference design and QA artifacts. [Execution → QA]

## 2025-09-05 — Initial implementation snapshot
- Implemented packages: `frontend`, `backend`, `shared`.
- Added documentation: `docs/governance_traceability.md`, `docs/qa_plan.md`.
- Added minimal automated tests (placeholders) and CI workflow to validate docs and run tests.
- Notes: `docs/product_backlog.md` and `docs/execution_log.md` added to close Governance DoD.

## How to use
- Append new entries with date, owner, and links to PRs or commits.

## 2025-09-05 — QA workflow hardening [Execution → QA]
- Scope Jest to JS tests to avoid TypeScript transforms in CI (`jest.config.cjs`).
- CI (`.github/workflows/qa.yml`) now runs: install, tests, type-check, and lint; retains doc presence verification.
- Rationale: Faster, more reliable CI with explicit type and lint gates; aligns with Execution Agent Prompt expectations.
- Suggested tests:
	- Add at least one unit test per package (`shared`, `backend`, `frontend`) in `packages/*/tests` covering happy path and an edge case.
	- Add a smoke test that starts the backend and asserts `/health` returns 200 (already scaffolded in backend tests).
