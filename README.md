Quick start

1. Read the project vision and design in `docs/vision.md` and `docs/design.md`.
2. See the product backlog and execution plan in `docs/product_backlog.md` and `docs/execution_log.md`.
3. Run tests (if present) under `tests/`.

Docs

- `docs/vision.md` — product vision
- `docs/design.md` — design details
- `docs/product_backlog.md` — backlog and in-flight items
- `docs/execution_log.md` — execution notes and gating decisions
- `docs/qa_plan.md` — QA plan and acceptance criteria
- `docs/governance_traceability.md` — governance traceability matrix and audit notes

Repository hygiene

- `src/` — application source (placeholder)
- `tests/` — tests (placeholder)

If anything in the DoD is missing, see `docs/governance_traceability.md` for current gaps and owners.
